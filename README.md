# Gitpod for WordPress

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) is a ready-to-code dev environment with a single click. It will allows you to develop your plugin or theme directly from your browser.

## Features

- LAMP (Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org)
- [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/)
- [Mailcatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/)

## Install

Just copy the `.gitpod.yml` and `.gitpod.dockerfile` to your project root directory.

- If your project is a theme, change the `wp_setup_plugin` to `wp_setup_theme` in your `.gitpod.yml`.
- By default, the webserver will use `PHP v7.3`. If you need a different version, change it on `ENV PHP_VERSION` in your `.gitpod.dockerfile` (line 4).

## Usage

Now you access `https://gitpod.io/#<url-of-your-github-project>`.

Example: [https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/luizbills/wp-tweaks/](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/luizbills/wp-tweaks/)
