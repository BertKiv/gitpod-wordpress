# Gitpod for WordPress

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) is a ready-to-code dev environment with a single click. It will allows you to develop your plugin or theme directly from your browser.

## Features

- LAMP (Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org)
- [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/)
- Git
- SVN

## Install

Just copy the `.gitpod.yml` and `.gitpod.dockerfile` to your project root directory and push to your remote repository.

- If your project is a theme, change the `wp-setup-plugin` to `wp-setup-theme` in your `.gitpod.yml`.
- By default, the webserver will use PHP `v7.3`. If you need a different version, change it on `ENV PHP_VERSION` in your `.gitpod.dockerfile` (line 4).

Also, `wp-setup-plugin` (ou `wp-setup-theme`) will search for a `.init.sh` file in your project root directory and execute it (if exists). Then, you can use the `wp-cli` to install plugins, install themes, and [more](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/). 

```sh
# file: init.sh
wp plugin install woocommerce --activate # install WooCommerce
wp plugin activate ${REPO_NAME} # activate your plugin
```
